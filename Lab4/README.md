# Lab 4: Signaling With Multi-Process & Multi-Threaded Programs
## Author: Luke Dependahl


### Program Desciption

This lab demonstrates the use of signals for inter-process and inter-thread communication. These two types of communication are implemented in two different programs both with the goal of completing the same task. Both programs create a thread or processes respectively. Each thread has a main function, a reporting function, three signal counting functions, and three signal generating functions.
